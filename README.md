# AI-Powered Glycemic Response Modeling and Simulation

This project models the glycemic response of local Nigerian meals (Maize and Millet Dambu) and predicts diabetes risk using a regression model. It also simulates antibiotic resistance in bacteria under drug pressure.

## Features
- Preprocessed glucose dataset
- Regression model with Scikit-learn
- Glucose response trend visualization
- Bacterial resistance simulation
- Ethical AI report

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `glucose_model.py` to train the model
3. Run `glucose_response_plot.py` for the trend visualization
4. Run `simulation.py` to simulate bacterial resistance
